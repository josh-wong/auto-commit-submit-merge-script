# Commit-submit-merge script

By using the commit-submit-merge script and configuring the script as a task in Task Scheduler in Windows, you can automate the commit, submit, and merge process for pull requests in GitHub.

> **Note**
> 
> This script currently only supports submitting and merging a pull request to the main branch.

This script can be particularly helpful for when you want to automatically commit changes regularly with a standard, descriptive summary. After that, the script will create a pull request to the main branch and then merge that pull request.

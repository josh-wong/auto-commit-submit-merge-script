# ðŸš§Script to commit changes, then submit and merge a pull requestðŸš§

This batch script is for committing changes and then submitting and merging a pull request.

> **Note**
> 
> This script currently only supports submitting and merging a pull request to the main branch.

To automate this script, you can add a task in Task Scheduler in Windows. For details on using Task Scheduler, please see [Task Scheduler for developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page).

# Getting started

Before you set up the **ommit-submit-merge** script, make sure you have the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- GitHub or GitLab account

!!! note
    
    I have tested and confirmed that this script works with a GitHub account. However, I have not tested it with a GitLab account, so the script may or may not work as expected.
